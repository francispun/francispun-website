This diverse collaboration was essential as we generated innovative ideas aimed at enhancing business processes. I led the design project to develop a virtual prototyping web app, working closely with design team members and leveraging the power of AI to streamline our efforts."

         "description": "The first phase of the project focused on design thinking, where we brainstormed several business innovation ideas. By integrating insights from various departments, we identified key areas for improvement and developed solutions that could transform our approach to product development. The integration of AI played a significant role in this phase, helping us analyze data and generate creative concepts more efficiently. This technological aid allowed us to explore possibilities that might have otherwise been overlooked, enriching our design process."

         "title": "Development for Enhanced Prototyping",
         "description": "In the second phase, I directed the development of the app, ensuring it effectively reflected the insights gained during our initial discussions. The virtual prototyping web app minimizes the initial prototyping efforts, allowing clients to explore and interact with 3D models before creating physical prototypes. While clients will ultimately want a tangible object to examine, this app significantly reduces the time and resources spent on preliminary designs. By enabling virtual exploration, clients can make informed decisions and adjustments early in the design process, ultimately leading to more successful final products."

           "The app is designed with user-friendliness in mind, allowing clients to easily navigate and interact with their 3D models. Users can seamlessly browse preload models or open their own files with just a few clicks. The interface is intuitive, enabling users to drag and reposition components effortlessly, and rotate the models simply by swiping on the screen.",
           "A standout feature of the app is its augmented reality (AR) capability, which bridges the virtual and physical worlds. This powerful functionality allows clients to visualize new product designs in real-time, placing virtual prototypes alongside existing products or within actual environments. By seeing how a new design fits within the context of previous versions or the product family, clients gain a deeper understanding of its impact and can make more informed decisions."
