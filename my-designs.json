        "title": "Project Overview",
        "description": "Izakaya AI is a single-page web application that transforms the casual dining experience. Born from a discussion with a restaurant owner, it addresses the primary limitation of self-ordering kiosks: they are static tools that demand the user do all the work. While digital menus are efficient, they lack the intelligence to guide a customer. This project solves that by embedding a smart, context-aware agent directly into the ordering workflow."

        "description": [
          "The core of the application is an AI that moves beyond simple Q&A to act as a personalized dining concierge.",
          "Contextual Intelligence: The AI monitors the user’s active cart in real-time. If a guest orders sake, the AI recognizes the flavor profile and immediately suggests compatible yakitori skewers, rather than random items.",
          "Frictionless Utility: The goal is to reduce the distance between decision and action. Recommendations are not just text; they are rendered with interactive '+Add' buttons, allowing users to act on the AI's advice instantly.",
          "Adaptive Communication: It supports English, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese, adapting not just the language, but the depth of explanation required for ingredients and culinary terms."

          "Instead of a complex vector database, the application injects the structured menu JSON and the conversation history into every prompt. This lightweight approach gives the AI 'perfect memory' of the session without backend latency. The objective was to demonstrate that by strictly managing context and state, we can transform a generic LLM into a domain-specific tool that feels distinctively helpful, personal, and smart."

Key design elements include a prominent, eye-catching profile picture and a clean presentation of the user's name and professional details. To ensure accessibility, a language toggle switch is strategically placed in the top-right corner, allowing viewers to instantly swap between English and Chinese versions of the profile without reloading the page or losing context."

          "To maximize conversion—defined here as successfully saving a contact—we have engineered a persistent User Experience (UX) feature. A floating 'Add Contact' button remains sticky at the bottom of the screen, hovering above the content regardless of how far the user scrolls. This eliminates the need to scroll to the footer to find action buttons. Upon clicking, this button triggers the device’s native contact application, prompting the user to save the new contact immediately."

This ensures that the downloadable contact file always matches the language currently displayed on the screen."

        "description": " In the manufacturing world, the gap between a digital concept and a physical sample is often where projects stall. Our clients faced long development cycles, needing weeks to validate designs before moving to tooling. The objective was to create a rapid solution to confirm design direction immediately, reducing the risk of costly revisions and shortening time-to-market."

        "description": "Although my background is in Industrial Product Design, I initiated and directed the development of this web application to solve our workflow challenges. Facing the technical hurdle of coding the app from scratch, I utilised AI as a collaborative coding partner. I engineered the prompts and directed the AI to generate the necessary code structure, successfully building a functional AR/VR platform despite not being a software engineer. This approach allowed me to translate the design team's vision directly into a working digital tool."

In this environment, users can drag the screen to rotate the view, change camera angles, and move individual parts to understand the assembly. It serves as a seamless digital workspace where validation happens without specialised software."
      },
      {
        "title": "Real-Scale AR & Production Confidence",
        "description": "The standout feature for decision-making is the Augmented Reality (AR) mode, which anchors the 3D model into the physical world at a strict 1:1 scale. While users typically walk around the anchored object to view different angles, I implemented a specific rotation control to spin the object on its vertical axis. This ensures clients can inspect every side, even in tight spaces, giving them the confidence to approve designs for physical prototyping."

      {
        "title": "Empowering Sales & Internal Communication",
        "description": "Beyond engineering, the app serves as a vital tool for sales and marketing. I implemented a dynamic colour-changing feature available in both modes. While material finishes are pre-set to ensure production feasibility, stakeholders can instantly visualise different colourways. This feature was particularly well-received by clients, who adopted the app for internal team discussions to align on aesthetics before production began."

      {
        "title": "Conclusion & Impact",
        "description": "By stepping outside the traditional boundaries of industrial design and leveraging AI to build a custom software solution, I delivered a tool that cut development lead times. The application impressed our clients, who welcomed the innovation and immediately integrated it into their internal review processes, proving that the tool successfully bridged the gap between concept and manufacturing."

      "As a UX designer, my primary objective was to create an app that places significant emphasis on simplifying and enhancing the pet adoption process. In Hong Kong, where most adoption centers rely on social media platforms for adoption applications, there exists a potential gap that the app seeks to address.",

This included creating detailed personas to gain a comprehensive understanding of the target audience and their needs. Additionally, I designed both paper and digital wireframes to conceptualize the app's user interface. To bring the designs to life, I developed low and high-fidelity prototypes that were used to conduct usability studies, allowing for valuable user feedback.",
      "The project's iterative design process allowed for continuous improvement and refinement of the app's functionality and user experience.
